- 👋 Hi, I’m @techwday
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain, Distibuted systems, and securing systems by leveraging Fully Homomorphic encryption (FHE) and Secure multi-party computation (MPC).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MPC, FHE. I am leveraging GoLang and Lattigo for lattice based FHE. I have started to investigate nufhe as a solution for fast comparison over encrypted data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Blockchain technology leveraging FHE. Can the EVM be made to run FHE?
- 📫 You can reach me at techwday@gmail.com
